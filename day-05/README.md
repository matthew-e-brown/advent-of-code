# Day 5

When I first wrote this one, I challenged myself to do it without using any
regular expressions; I parsed and counted the characters myself. That version
exists in the [`day-05-challenge`](./day-05-challenge) directory.

However; Advent of Code is usually about picking the right tool for the job,
so I redid it using regular expressions in [`day-05-regex`](./day-05-regex).

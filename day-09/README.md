# Day 9

For the longest time, I tried to do this with a graph. First, I thought it was a
directed graph, which lost me some time; then I tried it on an undirected graph
using Kruskal's algorithm. The latter of which at least gave me an answer, but
not the right one.

I eventually gave up and decided to take the
practical-to-implement-but-inefficient method of simply looping through all the
permutations and counting.

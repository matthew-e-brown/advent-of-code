# Advent of Code

This repository holds all of my [Advent of Code][aoc] solutions. For the most
part, they will be written in Rust, though I may use some other languages from
time to time.


## Branches

I originally started this repository back in 2021, when I was learning Rust for
the first time. I've gotten much better at the language since then, so looking
at my old code is a bit... painful. So, in 2024, I've decided to start afresh,
on a brand new `main` branch.

The old state of the repository from 2021 is available on the `legacy` branch.
That branch has my original solutions for the first 15 days of 2015 and a few
days from 2021. The plan is that, eventually, I'll merge all that stuff into the
current `main` branch and redo them all.

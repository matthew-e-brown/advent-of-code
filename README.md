# Advent of Code

This repository holds all of my solutions for all years of Advent of Code. It
also holds extra libraries and utilities I use commonly across different days
and years.

The code in my libraries will not be used to solve and Advent of Code problems
directly; they are just to abstract away things like reading files into strings
and parsing CLI arguments.

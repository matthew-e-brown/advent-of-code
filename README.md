# Advent of Code 2015

In preparation for Advent of Code 2021, I wanted to go back and try some of the
older challenges. I figured it made the most sense to start from the very
beginning.

I would like to try as many of these in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as
possible (for the challenge/to gain experience with it), but I may use some
other languages at some point.

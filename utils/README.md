# Advent of Code Utilities

This Rust library contains common utilities I found myself retyping when writing
Advent of Code solutions in Rust. It mostly features a Clap template and a
couple other functions for displaying.

The code in this library will not be used to solve and Advent of Code problems;
I intend to keep all of my Rust solutions to the `lib.rs` of any given day's
package and its modules. This library is just used to abstract away file reading
and CLI parsing.

# Advent of Code 2021

I'm usually writing my solutions just after midnight and I'm usually rushing;
you are legally not allowed to judge the quality of this code. :smile:

Since I'm solving 2021 as it comes out, I'll be using any language without
restrictions. If my solution is a Bash one-liner, it'll be a `.sh` file or even
just a line in a readme. Of course, because of my skill-set, that means most of
this will be in JavaScript.

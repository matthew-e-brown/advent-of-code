# Advent of Code 2015

In preparation for Advent of Code 2021, I wanted to go back and try some of the
older challenges. I figured it made the most sense to start from the very
beginning.

I will be trying to do all 25 challenges in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
both for the challenge and to gain experience with it. I will also be attempting
to be as "proper" as possible: just because I know my puzzle inputs are all
valid doesn't mean I won't catch and handle errors&mdash;each day will produce a
full binary application that can run any given input.

Hopefully I don't break and have to resort to JavaScript üòÅ

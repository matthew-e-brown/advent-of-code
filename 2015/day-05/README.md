# Day 5

When I first wrote this one, I challenged myself to do it without using any
regular expressions; I parsed and counted the characters myself. That version
exists in the [`challenge`](./challenge) directory.

However; Advent of Code is usually about picking the right tool for the job, so
I redid it using regular expressions in [`regex`](./regex).
